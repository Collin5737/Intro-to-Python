notes Chapter 1

python interpreter = is a computer progrram that executes code written in python programming language

interactive interpreter = An interactive inertpreter is a program that allows the user to execute one line of code at a time

code = is a common word for a textual representation of a program ( hence programming is  also called coding) a line is a row of text.


expressions = are codes that return a value when evaluated for example,the  code wage hours weeks is an expression that computers a number . the symbol is used for multiplication.


the names wage hours weeks and salary are varibales which are anmes refrecnes to values stored by the interpreter.

A statement is a program instuction . A program mostly consists of a series of statements and each statement usually appers on its own line

the print () function displays variables or expression values.

example:
hours = 15 
rate =21.00
pay = hours * rate 
print("we owe you")
print(pay)

= sep"" puts a space in between
= end "" 

Varibales are reserved memeory locations to store values this means that when you create a varibles you reserve some space in memory

text  enclosed in quotes is known as a string print ("hello world")

example of varibale:

pizza = 3

slices  = 8

people =5

print ("slices_per_person:")
print (pizza * slices / people)

Input= This function will stop execution of a program and allow the user
to interact with the program to provide realtime interaction
(or the realtime setting of a variable)






pizza = int(input("number of pizzas:"))
slices = int(input("number of slices per pizza: "))
students= int(input("number of students:"))

slices_per_student = pizza * slices / students

print ('we all get:' , slices_per_student)
